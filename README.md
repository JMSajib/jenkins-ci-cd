# CI/CD Pipeline for Java Application using Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, and Minikube

This guide provides a step-by-step setup of an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a Java application. The pipeline integrates with tools like SonarQube for code quality checks, Argo CD for Kubernetes-based deployments, and Minikube for local Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are available:

- Java application code hosted on a Git repository
- Jenkins Server ([Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu))
- Minikube installed locally ([Minikube Installation Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/))
- SonarQube Server ([SonarQube Installation Guide](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/10.4/setup-and-upgrade/install-the-server/installing-sonarqube-from-zip-file/))
- Argo CD for continuous deployment

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install Necessary Jenkins Plugins

1. **Docker Pipeline Plugin**:  
   This allows us to run the pipeline inside a Docker agent, simplifying environment management (e.g., cleaning up images, automatic removal of containers, and volume handling).
   
2. **SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins**:  
   Required for integrating SonarQube code quality analysis into the Jenkins pipeline.

---

### 2. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline

1. **Create a pipeline job** in Jenkins and configure it with the Git repository URL of your Java application.
2. **Add the Jenkinsfile** path from your repository.

---

### 3. Set Jenkins Variable

1. **Generate Github Personal Access Token** You need to generate personal access token and save in credentials section as a secret.
2. **Docker Credentials** For push the docker image, you need to store the docker credentials.
3. **SonarQube Token** For accessing SOnarQube, you need to generate sonarqube secret token and store this to the jenkins.
3. **SonarQube IP Address** For accessing SonarQube Server, you can store the IP Address but its optional.
3. **Github Email Address** You can store the github email address but its optional.

---

### 4. Define Jenkins Pipeline Stages

- **Stage 1: Checkout Code**  
  Checkout the source code from the Git repository.

- **Stage 2: Build Application**  
  Build the Java application using Maven.

- **Stage 3: Code Quality Analysis**  
  Run SonarQube analysis for code quality checks.

- **Stage 4: Build Docker Image**  
  Build and push the Docker image to a Docker registry.

- **Stage 5: Update Kubernetes Manifests**  
  Clone the manifest repository, make necessary changes, and push updated files for Argo CD.

---

### 5. Install Minikube on Local Machine

To deploy the application locally on Kubernetes, Minikube must be installed.

- Follow the official documentation for Minikube installation:  
  [Minikube Installation Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

---

### 6. Setting up Argo CD

1. **Install Argo CD** on your Kubernetes cluster. Click the install button to find the full process. ([Argo CD installation](https://operatorhub.io/operator/argocd-operator))
2. Install the Argo CD default cluster by following this. Create a YML file, paste the configuration, and apply your YML. ([Argo CD default clusters](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/basics/))
3. Type the following command to check the services:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc
   ```

   You should see the service `example-argocd-server`.

4. Now, type the following command to edit the service:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit svc example-argocd-server
   ```

   Find the `type: ClusterIP` and change it to `type: NodePort`.

5. Now we can login to our Argo CD UI by tunneling. Type
    ```bash
    minikube service example-argocd-server
    ```
    It will provide you `http://` link for login to the Argo CD UI, do not close this terminal.
6. By default admin is the username and password is stored in the secret. Type 
    ```bash
    kubectl get secret
    ```
    You should get `example-argocd-cluster`. Now, type
    ```bash
    kubectl edit secret example-argocd-cluster
    ```
    copy the admin password but its encrypted, so we have to decode this. Now, type
    ```bash
    echo copy_password | base64 -d
    ```
    It will provide the password and ignore the `%` character if it appears. Now paste this to the UI and you should login to the Argo CD.
---

### 7. Configure Argo CD with Github

1. Click the Create Application
2. Give the application name
3. Give the project name to `default`
4. Select Sync `automatic`
5. Give the github repo URL
6. Give the path of deployment yml (e.g. if the deployment in the same level then put just `.` or you have to give the path).
7. Select the provided cluster url
8. Give `default` namespace in the namespace section

---

### 8. Run the Pipeline

- Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI process.
- Monitor the pipelineâ€™s progress and resolve any issues during the stages.
- If build is successful then Argo CD will create the pods and services
- Find the service name and type 
```bash 
 minikube service service-name 
```
It will generate a tunnel url and you can access this by your browser.
- Change your code (e.g. add some text `hello world` and push to the github and trigger the pipeline)
- Argo CD will automatically observe the changes and deploy the deployment files

This guide automates the entire CI process for Java application, from code checkout to production deployment, using Jenkins, SonarQube, and CD process with Argo CD with Kubernetes(minikube) deployment.
